# ansible-poc

Some PoC with ansible src

## Main goal

The main idea is to drop all code thar we don't need for the initial tests and use a pythonic way for passing the parameters

## At least we need for initial tests:

- Return all results in a json format (no print them)
- Pass playbooks
- Generate inventory
- Pass vars witout the need of a vars file
- Pass keys files to access the servers
